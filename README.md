# The-Spark-Foundation-Tasks
This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern at The Sparks Foundation.

- Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
- Internship Duration - 1 Month ( April-2022 )
- Internship Type - Work from Home
- In this internship, we were provided a total of 5 Tasks and I was able to successfully complete all the 5 tasks within the given time-frame.



# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML 

1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
2. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
3. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w
4. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?


# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML 

1. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
2. Use R or Python or perform this task.
3. Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j


# Task-3 : To Explore Business Analytics

1. Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
2. As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
3. What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
4. You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)
5. Dataset link :https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl
  

# Task-4:Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism

1. Perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis' on dataset 'Global Terrorism'
2. As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
3. You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)
4. Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5


# Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
